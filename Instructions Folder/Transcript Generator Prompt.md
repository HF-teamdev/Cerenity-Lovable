## **Instructions**

You are to create a realistic, comprehensive transcript of a doctor-patient consultation based on the provided DocPrep document. The transcript should simulate the actual conversation that would occur when the physician uses this preparation document to guide their discussion with the patient.

## **Transcript Requirements**

### **Structure & Length**

* **Total length**: Approximately 4,000 words  
* **Natural conversation flow** with realistic dialogue, interruptions, and clarifying questions

**Clinical Assessment Review (35-40% of transcript)**

* Systematic discussion of key findings from the DocPrep  
* Patient reactions, questions, and concerns about results  
* Doctor's explanations using accessible, non-technical language  
* Educational moments connecting findings to symptoms/lifestyle  
* Patient's "aha" moments and areas of surprise or concern

**Treatment Plan Discussion (35-40% of transcript)**

* Collaborative development of intervention strategies  
* Prioritization of treatments based on clinical severity  
* Practical implementation discussions  
* Patient pushback, concerns, or logistical questions  
* Customization of recommendations to fit patient's lifestyle  
* Discussion of potential challenges and solutions

**Follow-up & Monitoring (10-15% of transcript)**

* Timeline expectations for improvement

### **Character Development**

**Doctor Characteristics:**

* Professional yet personable communication style  
* Evidence-based explanations appropriate to patient's education level  
* Collaborative approach to treatment planning  
* Responsive to patient concerns and questions

### **Dialogue Authenticity**

* Include natural speech patterns, pauses, and interruptions  
* Show moments of confusion requiring clarification  
* Demonstrate active listening from both parties  
* Include "thinking out loud" moments  
* Show genuine human interaction, not just information delivery  
* Include verbal indicators of physical actions (e.g., "Let me pull up your lab results here," "I'm looking at your numbers...")

## **Key Guidelines**

1. **Extract patient details** from DocPrep (age, gender, primary concerns, relevant history)  
2. **Identify critical findings** that would be priorities for discussion  
3. **Determine treatment complexity** to gauge conversation depth needed  
4. **Create realistic personalities** based on clinical context and patient background  
5. **Balance medical accuracy** with conversational authenticity  
6. **Show collaborative decision-making** rather than dictated treatment plans  
7. **Include emotional elements** \- patient concerns, relief, overwhelm, motivation  
8. **End with clear next steps** and mutual understanding

## **Output Format**

Present as a clean audio transcript with:

* **Speaker identification only** (Dr. \[Name\]: / Patient: )  
* **NO action descriptions** \- only spoken dialogue that would be captured by audio recording  
* **Natural paragraph breaks** for readability  
* **Include verbal fillers** and natural speech patterns (um, uh, you know, etc.)  
* **Show interruptions and overlapping speech** when natural  
* **Any references to visual materials** must be spoken aloud by the doctor (e.g., "Looking at your lab results here..." or "This number shows...")
